## INSTALLATION :inbox_tray:

Head over to this repo's [releases page](https://github.com/angeldollface/language-dollmarkup/releases) and download the latest VSIX file. After you have done this, run this command from the same directory in which you saved your VSIX file:

```bash
code --install-extension language-dollmarkup-0.1.0.vsix
```

## BUILD FROM SOURCE :hammer:

Make sure you have the following tools installed and available from the command line:

- [Node 15.x+](https://nodejs.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.org)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

After you have confirmed that both are installed, execute the following steps to build this extension from source:

- 1.) Download the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angeldollface/language-dollmarkup
```

- 2.) Change directory into the source directory's root:

```bash
cd language-dollmarkup
```

- 3.) Install the extension's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- 4.) Build the source code into a VSIX file:

```bash
npm build
```

- 5.) This should produce a VSIX bundle called `language-dollmarkup-0.1.0.vsix` in the `language-dollmarkup` directory.

- 6.) To install this extension, simply run this command:

```bash
code --install-extension language-dollmarkup-0.1.0.vsix
